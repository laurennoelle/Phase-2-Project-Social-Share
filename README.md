# Social Share

Social Share is a social media platform that lets the user interact and connect with friends; allowing you to friend someone which will need to be accepted on the friend's profile created by members of Flatiron School.

Users will be able to:

* Landing page: sign up/log into the platform 
* Signup page: collect basic information (_name_, _photo_, _location_, _birthday_) and store it into the API to create a user account
* Login page: log into their personal profile using a _username_ and _password_
* Profile page: displays a personal profile with basic information that displays a list of friends they've invited and ones that have accepted the invites - showing all details


Technologies used: Our frontend was built with React.js and communicates with our json-server in our backend

This project was created using [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/)

## Goals

Our goal is to build a React application and simulate a 
professional work environment:

* plan out your wireframes and features
* pitch our app in a project proposal
* use Git/Github for our source control system to track code changes and collaborate with team
* have at least 5 components to keep our code well organized
* use at least 3 client-side routes using React Router
* create a json-server to create a RESTful API and make both a GET and a POST request
* utilize UI for our CSS styling

### Stretch Goals

* send a friend invite
* accept a friend invite
* filter through a search bar to find friends

## Expected Accomplishments 

* create 3-4 client-side routes using React Router in our nav bar/other UI element that allows users to navigate between routes
* use a controlled form to make our POST request to our json-server
* use PATCH request to our json-server to persist the like counts
* render friend profiles onto our social media page using array filter method and GET requests from our json-server
* organize our code into purposeful components in order to keep it clean and dry
* incorporate a UI framework for our styling with [react-bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/) or [Material UI](https://mui.com/)

## Challenges We Expect to Face

* incorporating client-side routing: organizing our components with the routes from the very beginning
* trying to implement a Web Hook

## Available Scripts
Fork and clone [our frontend repository] onto your local environment:  
In the project directory, install the dependencies by running:  
`npm install`  

In the project directory, you can run:  
`npm start`  
Runs the app in the development mode.  
Open http://localhost:3001 to view it in your browser.  


Fork and clone [our backend repository] onto your local environment:  
Install the dependencies by running:  
`npm install`  

To run your server in development mode, run:  
`npm run dev`  
While running in development mode, the server will re-load any time you make changes to the db.json file, so you can test our your seed data.  

While your server is running, you can make requests to http://localhost:3000. Check it out in the browser to make sure your server works!
